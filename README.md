# Binary-Tree
In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.\
This file contains functions such as creating a binary tree (not height-balanced), traversing techniques (pre-order, post-order, in-order and level-order), sum of all nodes, counting nodes (leaf and internal) and height of a binary tree.
